## Ruby Version
3.2.1

## Technologies
- Ruby on Rails;
- Tailwind CSS.

## Project Dependencies, Configurations & Database
The first thing we must do after cloning the project is setup all its dependencies/configurations/databases. We can use the code below to do it all in one step:

```
bin/setup
```

## Running The Project
To run this project we recommend you to use the below command:

```
bin/dev
```

You could also use `bin/rails server`, but it would not work properly showing the changes made using tailwind CSS. So it is better to stick with `bin/dev`.
